# Canvas

## The width and color of the stroke may be chosen by clicking the green round buttons below the canvas. By the way, have you ever used red-blue pencils?  

## The background color changes with time automatically, which means the background is bright during the day, while dark at night; of course you may change it as you like by clicking the day button or the night button.

## You will get a new canvas by clicking the new button.
